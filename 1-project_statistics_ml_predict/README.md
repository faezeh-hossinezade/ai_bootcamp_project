# Quera Bootcamp Projects

 [ ML-Clustering-Regression ]


## Project 1: ML-Clustering-Regression


### Overview
As part of Quera's bootcamp, we developed this project to apply my knowledge of statistics and machine learning. we explored data exploration techniques and implemented clustering algorithms to achieve a specific goal. 

### Technologies Used
* Python
*  Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

### Data
* **Data Source:** [<a href="project_doc.docx">project_coc</a>]
* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** [Describe the steps involved in cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.]
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  * [Summarize your findings from EDA, including visualizations.]

### Modeling
* **Clustering:**
  * Used K-means clustering to [explain the purpose of clustering in your project].
  * [Discuss the number of clusters, evaluation metrics, and results.]
* **Prediction:**
  * Employed [mention the prediction algorithm] to [explain the prediction task].
  * [Discuss feature engineering, model training, evaluation metrics, and results.]

### Results
* [Summarize the key findings and insights from your models.]
* [Include visualizations or tables to present results effectively.]

### Documentation
* For a more detailed explanation of the project, please refer to the `project_doc.docs` file.
